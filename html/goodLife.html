            Nobody gets anywhere living anyhow -Bishop Oyedepo David. We as humans in a whole really need to live a good life if we want to make it in life and make the world a peaceful place to live. Have you ever seen a successful man living a careless life?

            To live a good life, one of the first things to know is that whichever good you are doing has to come from your heart. Else there won't be any reward for it. The bible says love your neighbour as yourself, and me being selfish just clearly tells that I'm not obeying the instructions of the Lord almighty. And given God is our father, why won't a son obey his father. The bible again tells us "Obey your father and mother that your days may be lenghtened on earth."
