            Knowong the right thing to do and not doing it is wrong -John Mason. There are times when we just simply force our minds to take the wrong as the right and then we end up regretting such decisions. We as humans generally need to learn how to be honest with ourselves.

            Any/Everything (or almost) that is currently happening to anyone is surely as a result of a decision or the other made by that fellow in the past. You can't be taught every right thing, but you can learn and know how to do things right.

            One of the funniest things in life is how it is easier to do the wrong thing than to do the right thing. Whenever we have to choose between the wrong and right in any situation, our conscience and or the holy spirit whispers to us which is right but the devil or evil/bad part of our mind don't rest that easy. It keeps pushing on like the little baby that wants to eat from his mother. It's no wonder a lot of people give in to temptation very easy.

            In as much as it is harder to do the right thing, it is also easier to do the right thing but it takes Determination and Discipline along with a high level of will power.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have these things accompanied with some other good things like the holy spirit, wisdom, knowledge, optimism and more, it becomes much more easy to resist the wrong thing and do that which is right.
